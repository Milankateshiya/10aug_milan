    <h2>How can image repetition of the backup be controlled?</h2>
    <h3>ans.</h3>
    <p>The background-repeat property sets if/how a background image will be repeated.</p>
    <p>This task can be achieved by using the background-repeat property that will help us to control the repetition of the image. <br>
         The background-repeat property in CSS is used to repeat the background image both horizontally and vertically. <br>
         It also decides whether the background image will be repeated or not.</p>
         <pre><mark>background-repeat: repeat|repeat-x|repeat-y|no-repeat|initial|inherit;</mark></pre>
         <p>use no-repeat value for the background-repeat property if you do not want to repeat an image, in this case, the image will display only once.</p>
         <p>The background image is placed according to the background-position property.</p>
         <p></p>
