    <h2>Name a few CSS style components?
    </h2>
    <h3>ans.</h3>
    <p>A CSS style typically consists of a selector and a declaration block. </p>
    <p>The selector identifies the HTML element to be styled, and the declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.</p>
    <p>The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.

       <p> The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.</p>
        
        <p>Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.</p>
        
    <p> Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.</p>
    <h3>example:</h3>
    <pre>
        p{
            color:red;
            text-align: center;
        }

    </pre>
    <p>p is a selector in css.</p>
    <p>color is a property and red is the property value.</p>
    <p>text-align is a property and center is the property value.</p>
